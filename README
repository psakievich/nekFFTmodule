This module is utilizies the native intpnts routines within nek5000 to 
allow users to sample their data and then take FFT's of that data. 
To use these routines FFTW3 must be installed on your system, and linked
through the makenek file.  An example makenek file has been included.

Sampeling size is declared in the file 'MYFFT' which contains common 
blocks and parameters (basically the 'SIZE' file for the FFT routines).
You do not need to worry about the hpts routines, or the lhis parameter
in the SIZE file.  All of the variables are independent for this routine.
 
Domains can be decomposed, to different processors, but not in the
directions the FFT's will be performed.  For example, if doing 2d fft's 
of planes in a 3d data set, the entire 2d plane must be specified on a 
given processor, but different planes may be allocated to different 
processors.  FFTW is being used in a serial sense, and domain 
decomposition is placed on the user in the FFT_DEFINE_POINTS subroutine.

This is a USE AT YOUR OWN RISK routine and has not been tested or approved
for use in nek5000 by anyone from the development team.
